# NSS Group Project | Game Application

## Description
Some enterprising, young, software developer decided to build a simple web-based RPG that lets a human player fight against an array of different enemies. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough time to finish the project because aliens took over the Earth and everyone was shipped off to the plutonium mines.

Our job was to finish the game. Project displays a number of skills including prototypal inheritance and ajax calls.
